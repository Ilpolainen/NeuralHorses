# NeuroticDogRace

This is an experimental game made with Unity. It consists of implementation of neural network which is used to steer four-legged physics- and joint- based creatures.

"You are the purpose of life. From now on you will decide if this mindless organism is worthy of staying alive and it's  genes are to be passed ahead. You will decide which ones are useless mutations that are to be discarded and how strong the next mutations will be. You will also get to choose the complexity of their brains and the size of the population as you are nearly god.

The complexity of the brain will affect the behaviour of the creatures. More complexity means also more capability for complex action. However the evolvement of complex systemscan be slower.

You have some basic tools and ways to mutate the population. The creatures can be totally discarded and new totally random creatures will be born instead. Some of them you m ight want to keep, and just mutate them a bit. And some individuals seem to be good parents for a new baby. These creatures are not limited to bipolar breeding but instead multiple parents can be chosen for a new baby. But be aware, as the population size is stable, someone has to die to give space for the newborn."
